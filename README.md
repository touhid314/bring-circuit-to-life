# Dataset
A proprietary dataset has been developed for training the models. It is the largest circuit component dataset created to date and is not included in this repository.

# Contributors
I am having quite some trouble keeping up with the project by myself. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please knock me at touhid1.6021@gmail.com.
