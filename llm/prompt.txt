* prompt working okay:
what are you?
hey, please show me your netlist
show netlist
show the voltage between node 2 and 3
what nodes are R1 connected to
change the value of R1 to 100 ohm and get the voltage at node 5
show plot of voltage at node 2
show plot of voltage across the nodes 0 and 2
change value of V1 and V2 to 100V

* prompt not working:
change the value of one voltage source to 20V and the other to 5V and show the voltage across them
change the value of one voltage source to 20V and the other to 5V and show the voltage across their nodes
what is the value of R1
show plot of voltage across the capacitor
change value of V1 and V2 to 100V and plot the voltages at nodes 5 and 7
change value of V1 and V2 to 100V and plot the voltages at node 5 and and voltage and node 7
plot the voltages at node 5 and and voltage and node 7
